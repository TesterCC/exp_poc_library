UDP Flooder.
This is a 'Dos' attack program to attack servers, you set the IP always that you have permission to do it.
and the port and the amount of seconds and it will start flooding to that server.
Created by Xavi Fortes -> https://github.com/XaviFortes/Python-UDP-Flood
Usage : ./flood_udp
Press enter to continue and introduce the data.
